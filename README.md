# MathematicalFunctionsJS
Purpose: Little statistics library that has mean, median, mode, range and standard deviation. This is made so I can learn JavaScript for now, as this is not a big project, rather than just a small side-project made **for fun**.
It uses user input to choose the array and to select the designed statistics function through the console. In the future, i'll add visuals and graphics to represent the data in an orderly and visual manner.
